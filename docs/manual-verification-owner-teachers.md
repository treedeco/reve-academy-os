# Manual verification — Owner teacher master data (Phase 2B-1)

Status: **passed — Owner runtime verification complete**

Automated Playwright tests do **not** substitute for this checklist. Browser-level empty-state coverage exists in `e2e/owner-teachers.spec.ts` (isolated SQL fixture).

## Checklist

| # | Action | Expected result | Pass |
|---|--------|-----------------|------|
| 1 | Start Supabase local and reset DB | Services healthy; schema reset | ☑ |
| 2 | Seed alpha data | `npm run db:seed:alpha` completes | ☑ |
| 3 | Start app and login as Owner | Redirect to dashboard | ☑ |
| 4 | Open `/teachers` | Page loads; **강사** nav item visible | ☑ |
| 5 | Verify teacher list | Existing seed teachers (e.g. T-A1, T-A2) listed with active badges | ☑ |
| 6 | Create a teacher | Required fields validated; new row appears without full-page reload | ☑ |
| 7 | Reload after create | Created teacher persists | ☑ |
| 8 | Edit teacher contact fields | Save succeeds; updated values visible | ☑ |
| 9 | Reload after edit | Edited values persist | ☑ |
| 10 | Deactivate unassigned teacher | Confirmation required; status becomes **비활성** | ☑ |
| 11 | Attempt deactivate assigned teacher (e.g. T-A1) | Korean error about active assignments; teacher stays active | ☑ |
| 12 | Reactivate previously deactivated teacher | Status returns to **활성** when contract allows | ☑ |
| 13 | Empty state (optional) | Automated Playwright empty-state test passes | ☑ |
| 14 | Responsive layout (~390px width) | No horizontal overflow; forms usable | ☑ |
| 15 | Console/network/server | No blocking errors during create/edit/deactivate flows | ☑ |
| 16 | No physical delete | No delete button; teacher rows remain in database when deactivated | ☑ |
