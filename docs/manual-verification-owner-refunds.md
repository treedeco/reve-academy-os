## 12-step verification checklist

| # | Action | Expected UI | Expected DB / behavior | Pass |
|---|--------|-------------|------------------------|------|
| 1 | Start Supabase local | Services healthy | `npx supabase status` OK | ☑ |
| 2 | Reset DB | Clean schema | `npx supabase db reset` | ☑ |
| 3 | Seed alpha data | Seed script completes | `npm run db:seed:alpha` | ☑ |
| 4 | Start app | Login page loads | `npm run dev` | ☑ |
| 5 | Login as Owner username `reve` (password from `.env.local`) | Redirect to dashboard | Owner session active | ☑ |
| 6 | Open **환불 처리** (`/refunds`) | Page title and nav item visible | Owner-only route | ☑ |
| 7 | Verify eligible payments | Delta/Beta/Epsilon (reserved) visible; Alpha pending and Zeta refunded hidden | `fetchOwnerRefundablePayments` filter | ☑ |
| 8 | Verify excluded payments | Pending and already-refunded not listed | No client-side payment update | ☑ |
| 9 | Enter refund reason | Confirm button enabled only with non-empty reason | No DB write yet | ☑ |
| 10 | Confirm full refund | Confirmation dialog; row removed on success | `reve_process_payment_refund` RPC | ☑ |
| 11 | Reload page | Refunded payment stays absent; pass cancelled persisted | `payments.status = refunded` | ☑ |
| 12 | Console / network | No blocking errors | No 401/403/500 on refund read/process | ☑ |

**Checklist: 12/12 PASS**

## Sign-off

- Verifier: **Owner (REVE)**
- Date: **2026-07-08**
- Browser / device: **Desktop browser; mobile/responsive layout**
- Result: **passed**
- Notes: Owner confirmed PASS for `/refunds` using local Supabase, alpha seed data, with username `reve`. Verified refundable completed payment list, pending/already-refunded exclusion, student/course/pass/payment context display, required refund reason behavior, full refund confirmation dialog, successful refund processing, row removal after refund, reload persistence, and no blocking browser console or server runtime errors.

## Non-blocking observations

- Full refund only; partial refund and reversal are out of scope.
- Duplicate refund attempts show error (non-idempotent RPC contract).
- Integration tests may refund Beta payment before Playwright; Epsilon reserved pass remains Playwright refund target after seed reset.

## Remaining risks

- External payment provider integration is out of scope; refund is recorded via trusted RPC only.
- Financial operations require explicit confirmation; accidental double-submit is mitigated by pending/disabled UI state but not idempotent at RPC level.
